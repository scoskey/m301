## Course description

Linear algebra starts with the study of solutions to systems of linear equations. We will learn the standard algorithm to find solutions using matrices. Morever the subject becomes much deeper once one understands that the solutions to systems of linear equations form a mathematical structure called a vector space.

Solving linear equations may seem like a specialized tool, but linear algebra it turns out to be valuable in almost all areas of mathematics and its applications. We will explore applications such as finding statistical best fit, population modeling, and internet search.

### Anticipated learning outcomes

* Fluency with core linear algebra concepts
* Appreciate value of linear algebra in mathematics and related fields
* Use linear algebra to solve pure and applied problems

### Rough plan

* Weeks 1&ndash;3: Chapter 2, linear equations
* Weeks 4&ndash;6: Chapter 3, vector spaces
* Weeks 6&ndash;7: Chapter 4, orthogonality
* Week 8: Midterm exam
* Weeks 10&ndash;11: Chapter 5, determinants
* Weeks 12&ndash;14: Chapter 6-7, eigenvalues and singular values
* Weeks 15-16: Final exam

### Course format

The course will be delivered through synchronous remote class sessions. Each session will include a mixture of questions on previous material, discussion of new material, and an in-class activity.

## Grading

### Attendance, participation, and classwork 20%

You are expected to attend remote class sessions, and to be prepared to ask questions and discuss the material. Following the discussion, we will start an in-class activity. A portion of your grade will be based on your attendance, preparedness, attention, collaboration, and completion of the activities.

### Homework 40%

Homework will be assigned each week and collected the following week. Most exercises will be graded for both correcteness and mathematical style. Some will be graded for completeness only. You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers, and you are welcome to use online resources when you are stuck (please reference). But please keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly *write them in your own words*.

### Take-home exams 20% x2

Take-home exams will be given during the 8th week and the finals week of the class.

## Disclaimer

This syllabus is subject to change. While I don't expect any substantial changes, please allow for some flexibility. I will give notice before making any changes to the syllabus.
